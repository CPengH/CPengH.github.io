#### About me:

I am deeply passionate about developing interdisciplinary skills across software and firmware engineering, with a keen focus on emulation and automation processes.

My expertise encompasses programming languages such as **Python** and **C++**, **RTOS** architecture, development of ST microcontrollers, alongside proficiency in emulation and automation techniques.

Currently, I serve as an embedded software engineer, focusing on the development of STM32-based microcontrollers for advanced battery testing systems.

Previously, I had a co-op role at Solidigm (SK hynix) as a software engineer, where I contributed to designing **firmware modeling system** for innovative SSD controllers. My experience also extends to the electric vehicle industry, where I played a pivotal role in a **BMS** team that designed the first electric car model in Taiwan.

<!-- As a co-founder of the startup BuggiPro, I designed an automated production line that drastically reduced the cost of incubating beneficial insects. -->
