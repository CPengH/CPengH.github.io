#### About me:

I'm passionate about developing interdisciplinary skills across software engineering, firmware engineering, emulation, and automation.

My expertise spans programming languages such as Python and C++, as well as RTOS architecture, ST microcontroller development, and emulation and automation.

I'm currently working as an embedded software engineer involved in developing STM32-based microcontrollers for battery testing systems.

In my previous roles, I had a co-op opportunity with Solidigm (SK hynix) as a software engineer, designing firmware emulators for multiple cutting-edge SSD controllers. I also have experience working in the EV industry in a BMS team, designing the first electric car model in Taiwan.

<!-- As a co-founder of the startup BuggiPro, I designed an automated production line that drastically reduced the cost of incubating beneficial insects. -->
