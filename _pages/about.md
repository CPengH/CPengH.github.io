#### About me:

I am deeply passionate about developing interdisciplinary skills across **software and firmware engineering**, with a keen focus on embedded software development and emulation.

My experience includes:
- Firmware development for **battery testing system**.
- Firmware modeling for innovative **SSD** controllers.
- Software developement for **Battery Management System** in EV.

**C/C++**:
- Familiar with STM32 Microcontrollers, ARM cortex-M processor, RTOS.
- Bare metal developments of application code and drivers.
- The [Battery Cell Emulator](https://github.com/CPengH/CellEmulator_PureSW) project aims to be open-sourced, lightweight, and cross-platform.
- Exploring the architectural aspects of porting embedded frameworks (QP/C++) to existing systems.

**Python**:
- Passionate about solving data structure and algorithm questions on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/u/CPeng818/).
- Familiar with Pandas, NumPy, and [Dash](./assets/img/DashExample.png) for data collection, training, analysis, and visualization.
- Implementation of machine learning and [deep learning](https://cpengh.github.io/TAMU_CSCE676_FinalProject/) for text identification.
